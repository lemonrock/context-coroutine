# context-coroutines

[context-coroutines] is a Rust crate that provides a simple set of extensions to the [context](https://github.com/zonyitoo/context-rs) crate to provide stackful coroutines.

The intended use case is mostly for read and write (input and output, I/O) with socket file descriptors.

The developers are not associated with the authors of [context](https://github.com/zonyitoo/context-rs) but are extremely grateful for the work they've put into to a superb piece of code.
